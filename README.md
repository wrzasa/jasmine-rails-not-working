This is a minimal Rails 5 example for the problem with `jasmine-rails` I
described in this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46981445/jasmine-rails-gem-used-from-commandline-skips-all-my-specs-why

The problem is that `jasmine` specs are running from web, but skipping
all specs from commandline. If anyone has a suggestion, just answer the
above question or create a pull request... whatever ;-)
